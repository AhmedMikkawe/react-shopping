# Simple React Shopping Cart

This project created with react , react-bootstrap , react-router-dom

## in this project I wanted to keep everything simple

I used react-bootstrap because I never used bootstrap with react and I thought it's a good opportunity
in addition to focus on JS part more that css part

## JSON server

I could use json server and fetch data from it but I wanted to make it simple

## some features I thought about but didn't implement them because they are not required although I think they are important

- removing products from cart
- using local storage to make cart persistent after closing the broweser
- the ability to add counter for product
